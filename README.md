# be-manager
lessons I am learning

- you can do one-on-ones [really well](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/)
- productivity looks [totally different](http://www.tombartel.de//2016/07/05/recalibrate-your-productivity-sensors/) than when you coded more. You can't measure your success by your old metrics
- just like code, there are blog posts and videos about [how to do better](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/team-groups-culture) that really help
- the reason I feel overwhelmed is because I am currently an engineering manager, a product manager, and the face of the tech team in business meetings, and I am still learning how to improve in all of those roles
- people need to be shown respect by a manager, and one way to do that is by respecting their time
- managing is really about being a :poop: :umbrella: for the people you manage
- in other words, managers are there to protect everyone "below" them on the org chart [from as much crap from above as possible](http://shitumbrella.ideationkings.com/)
