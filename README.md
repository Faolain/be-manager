lessons I am learning

- you can do one-on-ones [really well](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/)
- productivity looks [totally different](http://www.tombartel.de//2016/07/05/recalibrate-your-productivity-sensors/) than when you coded more. You can't measure your success by your old metrics
- just like code, there are blog posts and videos about [how to do better](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/team-groups-culture) that really help
- the reason I feel overwhelmed is because I am currently an engineering manager, a product manager, and the face of the tech team in business meetings, and I am still learning how to improve in all of those roles
- people need to be shown respect by a manager, and one way to do that is by respecting their time
- managing is really about being a :poop: :umbrella: for the people you manage
- in other words, managers are there to protect everyone "below" them on the org chart [from as much crap from above as possible](http://shitumbrella.ideationkings.com/), 
```
"[Your] role is to protect it from pointless meetings,
unnecessary interruptions and random changes
so they can focus on doing their job."
```
- honesty and transparency are pretty much always the way to go.
- be empirical about people things. [For example, estimates](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html)
- protect the engineers' flow state!
- [senior engineers reduce risk](https://medium.com/@ztellman/senior-engineers-reduce-risk-5ab2adc13c97#.45prgrqbo), but
```
Through trial and error, engineers can identify the sorts of problems they enjoy solving.
A senior engineer should find a company which both has those problems, and knows it.
Anything else will lead to frustration, and eventually apathy.

- Language and phrasing is really important. [This article](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-cialdini-presuasion-20161023-snap-story.html) is very relevant to product and marketing, but it is also worth keeping in mind when talking to those that you manage. As an engineer, I sometimes pretend that humans only converse to exchange information, and make decisions completely rationally. But, even engineers don't really act that way.
